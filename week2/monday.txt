Function - reusable contained logic

Scope- where a variable can be used

var sayHello = function () {} is a function expression.
function sayHello () {} is a function declaration.


A function expression follows the same rules as variable assignment. Since the value of the reference is a function, that function is only available in the lines after the value assignment.
With a function declaration, no matter where you put it in your code, it behaves as if you wrote it as the very first line in your code.
Aside from that, they are functionally equivalent.
