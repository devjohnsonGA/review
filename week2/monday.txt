Important for documentation 
Tells people what it does
And how to use it

Function - reusable contained logic

Scope- where a variable can be used

var sayHello = function () {} is a function expression.
function sayHello () {} is a function declaration.


A function expression follows the same rules as variable assignment. Since the value of the reference is a function, that function is only available in the lines after the value assignment.
With a function declaration, no matter where you put it in your code, it behaves as if you wrote it as the very first line in your code.
Aside from that, they are functionally equivalent.

=====================

Functions are values
Can be referenced and passed into other functions as arguments 

Methods are functions for objects

Ie - .forEach to iterate through an array

.map to create a new modified version of an array

.reduce can do what map filter and forEach does

========================

Callbacks use a function sometime in the future
