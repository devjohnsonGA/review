Objects & context 

two concepts that are crucial for encapsulation and abstraction in Javascript: Objects and Context. Objects allow us to box up multiple functions and data under a single variable. Context determines which object "owns" a function while it's being invoked.

Objects = key value pairs collections

Nested collections = car.gears[1

Methods = object functions

Context is the object the function is attached to

'this' as a replacement for subject in question
