Intro to WDI

Learned about classmates

Schedule and pace have been established

Found its best to review days lesson day of and start/continue that days assignments

Productive struggle is apart of process

Try-google-ask peer-ask instructor (put time cap on issue!)

Office hours M-T-W 130-230p && 6pm-8pm

-------

Framing - CLI is faster and more precise

PWD- Print working directory tells you where you are on cli

Absolute path is list of all directories leading up to file ex. /directory1/directory2/file

Relative path is directions from where you are to where file is ./ = current ../ = parent

Ctrl-e = cursor to end of line
Ctrl-a = cursor to beginning
