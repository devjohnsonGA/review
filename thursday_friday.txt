Object oriented programming

OOP helps us to achieve the following...

Abstraction: Determining essential features
Encapsulation: Containing and protecting methods and properties
Modularity: Breaking down a program into smaller sub-programs

This is the basic idea behind OOP; we define a blueprint for an object and use it to generate multiple instances of it!
